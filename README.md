* [GitHub Repo URL](https://github.com/candracodes/cfried-portfolio)

## Foreword

* This application aims to accomplish the following:
    * Adhere to the [Assignment Guidelines](./assets/_guide/README.md) to ensure submission is in compliance with acceptance criteria
    * Begin construction of an initial online portfolio with advanced CSS (to be revisted later with working javascript events)

## Design & Development Notes

* At the moment, this portfolio is composed of HTML & CSS only
* In the future, I could see a use case for, at the very least, incorporating jQuery, FontAwesome, and React (as I learn it)

## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

## Mock-Up

* [Click here to view the wireframe this portfolio's structure is loosely based on.](https://4mxrwt.axshare.com/) 

* At a minimum, this portfolio should function this way:

## Future Release Plans
* Adding a "hamburger menu" for mobile views which, when clicked, will display nav options in an accordion style
* Adding categories to "My Work" so users can filter the image view
* Incorporating a javascript library for lightbox functionality, which will expand the images and display them in a carousel
* Incporating FontAwesome library to use icons with ease
* Optimizing images for faster site loading
* Meta tags/descriptions for increased SEO visibility
* Better visual representation of the footer section
