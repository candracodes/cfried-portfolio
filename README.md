# Candra Fried Portfolio â€” version 2
This project explores a new approach to my existing 2019 portfolio. Granted... it doesn't have the glitz and glam that my 2019 portfolio had (and it isn't optimized), but I just wanted to create a playground to try out new ideas. Still to come: a brand new, modernized, 2021 approach to my online portfolio.

## Foreword

* This application aims to accomplish the following:
    * Begin construction of an initial online portfolio with advanced CSS (to be revisted later with working javascript events)

## Design & Development Notes

* At the moment, this portfolio is composed of HTML & CSS only
* In the future, I could see a use case for, at the very least, incorporating jQuery, FontAwesome, and React


## Mock-Up

## Future Release Plans
* Adding a "hamburger menu" for mobile views which, when clicked, will display nav options in an accordion style
* Adding categories to "My Work" so users can filter the image view
* Incorporating a javascript library for lightbox functionality, which will expand the images and display them in a carousel
* Incporating FontAwesome library to use icons with ease
* Optimizing images for faster site loading
* Meta tags/descriptions for increased SEO visibility
* Better visual representation of the footer section
